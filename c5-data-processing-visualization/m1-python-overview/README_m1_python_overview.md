# 📘 M1 – Overview & Python Foundations  
**Folder**: `m1-python-overview`  
**Focus**: Reviewing core concepts and tools in preparation for the real-world data projects  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This offered a recap of foundational Python skills—without requiring new code—to ensure readiness for advanced data handling, analysis, and visualization tasks.

⸻

## 🛠️ Core Concepts Covered

- Workflow and deliverables  
- Refresher on data retrieval, processing, and visualization techniques  
- Overview of previously used Python tools  

⸻

## 🧰 Tools Highlighted (Conceptual)  
Although no coding was required in this, the following tools were reviewed for use in later projects:

- Python 3  
- `urllib` – Web data retrieval  
- `BeautifulSoup` – HTML parsing  
- JSON / XML data parsing  
- SQLite – Lightweight relational database  
- `matplotlib` / Google Charts – Visualization tools  

⸻

## 🧠 Practice File
- `python-review-practice.txt` – Written summary of core Python topics: string handling, file I/O, conditionals, loops, functions, web data parsing, and basic database usage.

⸻

## 💬 Reflection  
This helped frame this as a **culmination of applied skills**. It highlighted the transition from structured coursework to self-driven projects using live data. While no scripts were written, the reflection and review deepened my confidence in handling text parsing, APIs, file structures, and database logic—skills I would build upon immediately in the modules that followed.
