# 🌐 M5 – Raw Data Retrieval & Analysis Planning  
**Folder**: `m5-accessing-new-data-sources`  
**Focus**: Reflecting on data sourcing, early cleaning strategy, and planning the next steps for analysis  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This stage focused on evaluating raw datasets and refining how to retrieve, clean, and prepare them for analysis. Rather than writing code, the task emphasized strategy—documenting progress, identifying potential obstacles, and clarifying how to structure a meaningful analysis from real-world data sources.

⸻

## 🔍 Topics Explored

- Progress updates on chosen datasets  
- Retrieval techniques using web scraping or API methods  
- Common raw data challenges: formatting, missing fields, etc.  
- Structuring early analysis questions  
- Peer feedback on data preparation direction  

⸻

## 🛠️ Tools Referenced (Conceptual Only)

Although no scripts were created at this stage, several Python-related tools and workflows were discussed or reinforced:

- Python 3 data retrieval strategies  
- `urllib`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` (HTML scraping)  
- JSON / XML / CSV handling  
- APIs and data pipelines  
- Data cleaning workflows  
- Preparing data for SQLite or visualization libraries like `matplotlib`  

These tools become hands-on again in later stages of the analysis pipeline.

## 🧠 Reflection  
This checkpoint helped map the transition from **raw data** to **analysis-ready structure**. By stepping back from the keyboard, I was able to articulate:

- What data I wanted to explore  
- Why it mattered in a broader context  
- How I planned to clean and prepare it  

This strategy-focused pause clarified next steps and sharpened my approach before returning to hands-on scripting.
