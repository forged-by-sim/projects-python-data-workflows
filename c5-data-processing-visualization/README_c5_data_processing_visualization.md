# 📊 C5 – Data Processing & Visualization  
**Folder**: `c5-data-processing-visualization`  
**Focus**: Aggregating, visualizing, and exploring real-world datasets using Python  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This brought together all prior skills—text parsing, data cleaning, API handling, and file I/O—into a structured data pipeline. I learned how to access, process, and visualize real-world data sources using Python and SQLite.

Topics covered included:
- Building a simple search engine from scratch  
- Spidering and modeling email networks  
- Working with web APIs to access new datasets  
- Exploring and cleaning large data sets  
- Visualizing results using tools like `matplotlib`

## 🧪 Featured Projects

### 🔍 m2-search-engine-builder  
Constructed a basic search engine using inverted indexes and Python dictionaries to track word positions across multiple documents.

### 🕸 m4-email-spidering-modeling  
Wrote a web crawler to collect email metadata, store it in SQLite, and model sender–receiver relationships.

### 🧬 m5-access-new-data  
Accessed external datasets via APIs and web scraping, cleaning and storing the results in structured formats.

### 📈 m6-visualize-email-data & m7-visualize-new-data  
Created visualizations (networks, histograms, etc.) to reveal insights within email traffic and external datasets.

## 💭 Reflection  
These projects solidified my confidence in working with real-world, messy data. I learned how to design a lightweight pipeline—from extraction to visualization—and debug each part iteratively. The email spidering and SQLite modeling taught me how structured queries power real insights. These projects set the stage for deeper learning in data science and simulation analytics.
