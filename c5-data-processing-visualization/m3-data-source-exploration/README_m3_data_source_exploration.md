# 📁 M3 – Exploring Data Sources  
**Folder**: `m3-exploring-data-sources`  
**Focus**: Scouting potential datasets for analysis, visualization, or API-based workflows  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This phase of the project focused on identifying **real-world datasets** that could support future data-driven tasks using Python, SQLite, or APIs. It was a **planning and discovery stage** — the goal was to evaluate dataset quality, explore possible questions, and outline how various tools might be applied.

No code was required here. Instead, the task emphasized critical thinking about **data sourcing**, **feasibility**, and **analysis scope** before diving into scripting.

## 🔍 Key Topics Explored

- Choosing meaningful and relevant data sources  
- Examples of datasets in health, education, social science, and environmental sectors  
- File formats suitable for parsing and analysis: `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`  
- Brainstorming analysis questions and visualization opportunities  
- Evaluating feasibility of different data sources  

⸻

## 🧠 Concept Mapping Exercise

The task included a short write-up reflecting on:

- A dataset of interest  
- Why it was compelling  
- What questions could be asked or answered using that data  
- What type of processing or visualization might be needed  
- Potential Python tools or APIs to extract, clean, and display the data

This reflection helped guide future scripting decisions by rooting technical tasks in **real-world inquiry**.

## 🧰 Tools Referenced (Conceptual Only)

While no scripts were written at this stage, the following tools were considered for future use:

- Python 3  
- `urllib` – Web data retrieval  
- `BeautifulSoup` – HTML parsing  
- `json`, `xml` – Data interchange formats  
- SQLite – Lightweight relational database  
- `matplotlib`, Google Charts – Visualization libraries  

⸻

## 💬 Reflection  
This was a valuable **pre-project exploration**. It served as a reminder that successful data work begins with asking the right questions and selecting clean, well-structured sources. It also reinforced the importance of mapping tools to tasks — such as when to use APIs vs. scraping, or when to store results in a database vs. a flat file.  

Although no scripts were produced, the ideas generated here laid the foundation for future pipelines.
