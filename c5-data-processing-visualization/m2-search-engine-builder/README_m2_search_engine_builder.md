# 🔍 M2 – Search Engine Builder  
**Folder**: `m2-search-engine-builder`  
**Focus**: Building a mini search engine using spidering, PageRank, and force-directed graph visualizations  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This project introduced the fundamentals of **search engine design** by walking through the creation of a simplified PageRank-based crawler. The pipeline included spidering live web pages, storing relationships in SQLite, calculating link-based rankings, and visualizing the structure using HTML and JavaScript.

It combined **Python scripting, SQL modeling, and interactive graph rendering** into one cohesive system.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Spidering and crawling using `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup`  
- Building a relational schema in SQLite to store page/link data  
- Implementing a PageRank algorithm  
- Visualizing results with D3.js force-directed graphs  
- Debugging multi-stage pipelines

## 💬 Reflection  
This project taught me how **search engines model and rank the web** behind the scenes. More importantly, I learned how to manage dependencies across files, run scripts in the correct order, and debug broken visualizations. After completing this, I became more confident in designing and repairing **multi-layered technical workflows** that span code, databases, and front-end visual outputs.
