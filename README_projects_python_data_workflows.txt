## 🧭 About This Repository  

This repository showcases a series of hands-on Python projects focused on building **real-world data workflows**—from text parsing and API access to database modeling and visualization. Each collection introduces foundational skills and progressively scales up toward full-stack data processing pipelines using lightweight tools.

Projects blend scripting, file handling, SQL querying, and data exploration with clear goals and deliverables at every step. The final stage simulates how technical teams manage raw data and transform it into actionable insight.
