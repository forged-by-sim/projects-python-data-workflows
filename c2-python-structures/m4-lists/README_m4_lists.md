🧮 M4 – Lists, Duplicates & Sorting

Folder: m4-lists
Focus: Constructing dynamic lists, removing duplicates, sorting elements, and combining loops with conditionals

⸻

🎯 Overview

This module deepened my understanding of Python lists as dynamic data structures capable of storing and manipulating collections of information. I practiced list creation, iteration, duplicate elimination, and sorting—laying the foundation for clean data processing workflows.

Key techniques included:

Appending elements using .append()

Detecting duplicates using if not in logic

Sorting lists alphabetically and numerically

Tokenizing strings into list elements using .split()

Using for loops and if conditions to control flow

🧪 Projects & Practice
📬 Build a List of Unique Senders

Parsed a mailbox text file, extracted sender names from email lines, and compiled a deduplicated list.

📚 Create a Sorted Word List

Split a text into individual words, removed duplicates, sorted the list, and printed the results.

📘 Reflection

This module unlocked new possibilities for organizing and cleaning data. I gained confidence in transforming raw strings into meaningful structures, using loops and logic to build useful datasets from scratch. The ability to eliminate redundancy and order results will prove essential for simulation, XR metadata parsing, and backend logic.
