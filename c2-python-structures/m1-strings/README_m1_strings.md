# 🔤 M1 – String Manipulation & Text Parsing  
**Folder**: `m1-strings`  
**Focus**: Extracting and cleaning string data using Python methods and slicing

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced **text parsing and manipulation techniques** in Python. I explored how to search, slice, and clean unstructured text using built-in string methods.

Key functions practiced:
- `.find()`, `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, `.strip()`
- String slicing with `[:]`
- Working with delimiters like `@`, `:`, and whitespace

These tools laid the groundwork for extracting useful information from emails, filenames, and user input in real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Parsing structured text from messy strings  
- Extracting data using `.find()` and slicing  
- Cleaning text with `.strip()`, `.replace()`, and `.lower()`  
- Identifying delimiters and targeting substrings  
- Building scripts to transform user-generated input into structured data

## 💭 Reflection  
This module revealed just how much hidden structure lies within plain text. Using only a few built-in functions, I could isolate an email domain, clean the result, and extract usable information from noise.

These string manipulation skills will be essential in **data parsing, web scraping**, and **log file analysis** in future projects.
