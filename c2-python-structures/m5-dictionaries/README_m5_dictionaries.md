# 🗂️ M5 – Frequency Analysis with Dictionaries  
**Folder**: `m5-dictionaries`  
**Focus**: Using Python dictionaries for counting, pattern detection, and decision-making based on frequency  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced dictionaries as dynamic key-value structures for storing, retrieving, and analyzing data efficiently. I used them to track frequencies, identify patterns, and summarize text data programmatically.

Key techniques included:

- Initializing and populating dictionaries on-the-fly  
- Using `.get()` for safe key access and default values  
- Counting occurrences using loop logic  
- Extracting max values using iteration and tuple sorting  
- Applying dictionary logic to real-world text datasets

## 🧪 Project: Identify the Most Frequent Sender  
Parsed a mailbox text file, tracked how many times each sender appeared, and used a dictionary to determine the most frequent sender.

**Files:**
- `find-most-frequent-sender.py`  
- `find_most_frequent_sender1.png`, `find_most_frequent_sender2.png`

## 📘 Reflection  
This was one of the most impactful modules in the course. Dictionaries gave me a clear, efficient way to analyze data and detect trends—a core requirement for simulation event logs, training scenarios, and performance metrics. I now see dictionaries as essential tools in both structured pipelines and exploratory scripts.
