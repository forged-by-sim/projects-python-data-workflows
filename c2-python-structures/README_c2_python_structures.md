# 🧠 Python Structures: From Strings to Tuples  
**Folder**: `c2-python-structures`  
**Focus**: Core Python data structures—strings, lists, files, dictionaries, and tuples  

⸻

## 🎯 Objective  
This project deepened my foundation in Python by mastering the language’s built-in data structures. Each module builds practical skills for storing, organizing, and transforming information using strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and file-driven input/output.

By the end of this sequence, I could solve real-world problems using layered logic, clean syntax, and efficient Python workflows.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3 (local)
- `.txt` scripts and input files
- `.py` source code with printed output
- PNG screenshots of program results
- Command-line execution and testing

⸻

## 📁 Directory Structure

Each module includes assignments, screenshots, and logic-focused scripts:

c2-python-structures/
├── m1-strings
├── m2-python-file-setup
├── m3-files
├── m4-lists
├── m5-dictionaries
├── m6-tuples

## 🔑 Key Topics by Module

- **M1 – Strings**: Slicing, searching, formatting (`find()`, `strip()`, `replace()`)
- **M2 – File Setup**: System prep, file editors, running `.py` files
- **M3 – Files**: File I/O (`open()`, `read()`), `.split()`, line-by-line parsing
- **M4 – Lists**: Accumulation patterns, duplicate checks, sorting
- **M5 – Dictionaries**: Frequency counts, `.get()`, key/value logic
- **M6 – Tuples**: Ranking results, sorting by value, tuple unpacking

## 📘 Reflection  
This course leveled up my ability to think in Python. I learned to design logic for real-world challenges—mapping, ranking, filtering, and structuring messy data with clean, readable code.

These modules helped me see the *true power* of Python: not just as a scripting language, but as a robust tool for building simulation systems, analyzing logs, and crafting backend logic in XR and training applications.
