# 🧮 M6 – Sorting & Ranking with Tuples  
**Folder**: `m6-tuples`  
**Focus**: Using tuples to rank dictionary data and build leaderboard-style summaries  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced tuples—immutable sequences used for pairing and sorting values. I learned how to mix dictionaries and tuples to perform ranking operations and extract top results from datasets.

Key techniques included:

- Using `.items()` to convert dictionaries into tuples  
- Sorting by value using `sorted()` and `reverse=True`  
- Unpacking tuples in `for` loops  
- Building top-N and leaderboard-style outputs  
- Slicing and formatting results with tuple logic  

These skills are powerful for real-world applications such as ranking simulation participants, analyzing logs, or surfacing key insights from frequency data.

## 🧪 Project: Sort & Count Messages  
Built a script to parse a file, count how many messages came from each email address, convert the results into tuples, and display the top senders sorted by frequency.

**Files:**
- `sort-and-count-messages.py`  
- `sort_and_count_messages1.png`, `sort_and_count_messages2.png`

## 📘 Reflection  
Tuples completed the core of Python’s data structure toolkit. I now see how to combine dictionaries and tuples to analyze, rank, and summarize data. This logic is especially useful in simulation results, log parsing, or structured scoring systems—whenever you need “Top 5” or “Most Frequent” insights.
