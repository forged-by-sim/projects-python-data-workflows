# 📁 M3 – File Reading, Text Conversion & Data Parsing  
**Folder**: `m3-files`  
**Focus**: Reading text files, parsing line-by-line content, and extracting structured data from raw inputs  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module marked my first experience with Python interacting with external files—reading them line-by-line, cleaning their contents, and extracting structured data.

Key skills practiced:

- Opening and reading files using `.read()` and `.readlines()`  
- Cleaning strings with `.strip()`, `.upper()`, `.lower()`  
- Tokenizing and navigating lines using `.split()` and `.startswith()`  
- Using `for` loops to iterate through each line  
- Using sentinel loops and basic parsing logic to extract data

These techniques are foundational in real-world data workflows—especially useful in simulation logs, scenario scripting, and analytics pipelines.

## 🧪 Projects & Practice

### 🔠 Text File Reader & Formatter  
Read an external file and printed each line in uppercase, simulating string preprocessing.

**Files:**
- `read-file-and-convert-text.py`  
- `read_file_and_convert_text1.png`, `read_file_and_convert_text2.png`

---

### 📊 File Parser & Data Extractor  
Parsed structured lines from a file, filtered lines based on prefixes, and extracted numerical values or substrings.

**Files:**
- `read-file-and-process-data.py`  
- `read_file_and_process_data1.png`, `read_file_and_process_data2.png`

### 🧠 Practice File  
- `files-practice.txt` – Initial exercises with reading, cleaning, and iterating through files

## 🧘 Reflection  
This was the first time I used Python to interact with the “outside world.” I saw how to extract meaning from external files using loop patterns, string logic, and structure detection. These methods are powerful for simulation control files, training logs, or real-time data inputs—especially in extended reality and clinical scenarios.
