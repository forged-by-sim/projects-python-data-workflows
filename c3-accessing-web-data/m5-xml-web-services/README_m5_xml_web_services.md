# 🧩 M5 – Extracting Data from XML Web Services  
**Folder**: `m5-xml-web-services`  
**Focus**: Parsing structured XML data, navigating element trees, and extracting values from web services  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced **XML (Extensible Markup Language)** as a structured data format commonly used in web services and APIs. Unlike HTML, XML is designed to represent hierarchical data, making it ideal for configuration files, data feeds, and backend systems.

Using Python’s built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree`, I practiced reading XML documents, navigating nested elements, and extracting numeric values for aggregation.

Key skills practiced:

- Understanding XML structure vs. HTML  
- Parsing XML files using `ElementTree`  
- Navigating nested tags and attributes  
- Using `.find()` and `.findall()` for repeated elements  
- Extracting numeric values and computing totals from structured data

## 🧪 Project: XML Data Extraction  
Parsed an XML document retrieved from a web service to locate specific `<count>` elements, extract their numeric values, and compute a total sum.

## 📘 Reflection  
This module strengthened my understanding of **structured data extraction** and hierarchical parsing. Learning how to navigate XML trees prepared me for working with real-world APIs and simulation data feeds, where XML is still widely used—especially in healthcare, government, and legacy systems.

It also helped bridge the gap between raw web data and more modern formats like JSON, making future transitions between data representations much smoother.
