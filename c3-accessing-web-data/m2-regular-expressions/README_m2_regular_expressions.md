# 🔍 M2 – Extracting Data with Regular Expressions  
**Folder**: `m2-regular-expressions`  
**Focus**: Pattern matching, numeric parsing, and string filtering using Python’s `re` module  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced **regular expressions (regex)** as a compact and powerful mini-language for extracting and filtering data from strings. While optional in many scripts, mastering regex unlocks efficiency in handling emails, web content, logs, and other text-based datasets.

Key skills practiced:

- Regex syntax and pattern matching  
- Using `re.search()`, `re.findall()` and `re.compile()`  
- Filtering lines based on structured formats  
- Extracting numeric data from noisy or embedded strings  
- Applying conditionals and loops with regex logic

## 🧪 Project: Regex-Based Data Extraction  
Parsed a dataset of mixed-content strings using regular expressions to extract specific numeric values for aggregation.

**Files:**
- `regex-data-extraction.py` – Final Python script  
- `solution-regex-data-expressions.txt` – Written breakdown of the logic used  
- `prompt_regex_data_extraction.png` – Screenshot of the assignment prompt

## 📘 Reflection  
This was my first serious step into **pattern-based automation**. Combining regex with conditional logic opened the door to more compact, flexible scripts—especially for cleaning, sorting, and parsing real-world web data. It’s now part of my go-to toolkit for simulation logs and backend workflows.
