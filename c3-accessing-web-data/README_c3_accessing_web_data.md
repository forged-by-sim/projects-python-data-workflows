🧭 About This Repository

I've explored the foundations of internet data retrieval and processing pipelines using Python. I learned how to retrieve and parse HTML using urllib, extract structured data using regular expressions, interact with APIs over network sockets, and decode JSON responses. These skills are foundational for backend simulation workflows, API integration, and real-time data applications.

📘 Reflection

This has transformed how I approach web-connected data pipelines. It taught me how to go beyond static files and confidently access, filter, and manipulate live internet data streams. These are the kinds of automation and extraction skills that scale well across simulation, healthcare, training, and logistics systems — wherever real-time data is needed.
