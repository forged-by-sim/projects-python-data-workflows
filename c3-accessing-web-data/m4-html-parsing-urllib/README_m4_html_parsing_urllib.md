# 🌐 M4 – HTML Parsing with urllib & BeautifulSoup  
**Folder**: `m4-html-parsing-urllib`  
**Focus**: Accessing Web Data · HTML Scraping · Parsing with BeautifulSoup  
**Tools Used**: Python, `urllib`, `BeautifulSoup`

⸻

## 📦 Overview  
This module introduced the foundational tools for **web scraping** in Python—starting with `urllib` for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing. I practiced retrieving data from web pages, navigating tag structures, and extracting meaningful values from HTML elements.

Key skills included:

- Using `urllib.request.urlopen()` to fetch page content  
- Parsing HTML with `BeautifulSoup` and navigating tag trees  
- Extracting attributes like `href` from `<a>` tags  
- Traversing and aggregating data from multiple links or elements  
- Writing loop-based logic for automated scraping tasks  

⸻

## 🗂️ Subfolders & Projects  
Each project below applied scraping concepts to solve structured HTML parsing challenges:

### 🔗 `html-links-using-beautifulsoup`  
Follows a series of embedded links by selecting the 18th `<a>` tag in each HTML page, repeating the process 7 times. Designed to simulate **automated link traversal**.

### 🔢 `html-scraping-numbers-using-bs4`  
Parses a static HTML file, locates all `<span>` tags, extracts embedded numbers, and calculates the total sum. Demonstrates **data aggregation from tags**.

## 💡 Simulation Use Cases  
- Scraping training dashboards and scoreboards  
- Navigating nested simulation logs or instructional pathways  
- Collecting results or activity markers from web-based LMS platforms  
- Automating data collection from simulation provider pages
