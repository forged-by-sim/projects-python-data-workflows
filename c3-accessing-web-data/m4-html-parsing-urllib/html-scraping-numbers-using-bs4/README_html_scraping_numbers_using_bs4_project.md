# 🔢 Project – Scraping Numbers with BeautifulSoup  
**Folder**: `html-scraping-numbers-using-bs4`  
**Project Type**: Web Scraping · Data Extraction · HTML Parsing  
**Tools Used**: Python, `urllib`, `BeautifulSoup`  

⸻

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project focused on scraping **numeric values embedded in HTML `<span>` tags** using BeautifulSoup. The task involved parsing a static HTML file, locating all `<span>` elements, converting their contents to integers, and calculating the total sum.

I practiced how to:

- Read HTML data from a local file or URL  
- Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse tag-based structures  
- Locate elements by tag name with `soup('span')`  
- Loop through tags and extract numeric content  
- Build simple but powerful aggregators for web data

## 📂 Files Included  
- `html-scraping-numbers-using-bs4.py` – Final scraping script that extracts and sums `<span>` numbers  
- `comments_2237805.html` – Sample HTML file used for offline testing  
- `prompt_html_scraping_numbers_using_bs4.png` – Screenshot of original assignment instructions  
- `solution-html-scraping-numbers-using-bs4.txt` – Console output showing count and sum  
- `comments_2237807.xml` – XML-based version for a future task  
- `comments_2237808.json` – JSON-based version for comparison exercises

## 🧠 Key Learnings  
This assignment helped solidify my understanding of how to **traverse HTML trees**, extract targeted data, and **convert unstructured text into usable values**. I also learned how to filter tags, loop through them reliably, and avoid common scraping pitfalls.

I gained confidence in building repeatable patterns for:

- Web scraping  
- HTML parsing  
- Data aggregation from semi-structured sources

## 💡 Use Case Inspiration  
- Pulling stats from simulation dashboards with embedded `<span>` values  
- Scraping training logs or evaluation forms embedded in web-based LMS systems  
- Summing up user scores, error counts, or timestamps in automated reports
