# 🌐 M3 – Network Programming & Socket Basics  
**Folder**: `m3-network-sockets`  
**Focus**: Understanding the request/response cycle and using Python’s `socket` library for low-level web communication  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced foundational **network programming** using Python. I explored the client-server model, practiced decoding HTTP request/response headers, and learned how to simulate browser behavior using the `socket` library.

Key skills included:

- Understanding the HTTP request/response lifecycle  
- Using `socket` to send GET requests manually  
- Inspecting raw byte responses from web servers  
- Decoding and parsing response streams  
- Gaining insight into how data moves across the internet

## 🧪 Project: Understanding the Request/Response Cycle  
Simulated basic browser behavior by initiating a manual GET request to a web server and interpreting the server's raw response.

## 📘 Reflection  
This module pulled back the curtain on how the web works. I learned not only how to retrieve data—but why that data is structured the way it is. Understanding request/response cycles is foundational for any backend or data-driven simulation work. It also deepened my understanding of how APIs and websites communicate.
