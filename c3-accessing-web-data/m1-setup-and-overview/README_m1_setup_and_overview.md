# ⚙️ M1 – Setup & Development Environment  
**Folder**: `m1-setup-and-overview`  
**Focus**: Verifying Python installation, terminal execution, and editor configuration  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This initial module ensured I had a functional local Python setup and a code editor properly configured for script development. It emphasized terminal-based execution and marked the shift from browser-based learning to real-world Python workflows.

## 🧪 Environment Setup: Screenshot Submission  
As part of the setup validation, I submitted proof-of-environment screenshots covering:

- ✅ Python terminal running a basic `.py` script  
- ✅ Text editor open with Python source code  

**Files:**
- `python_terminal.png` – Python successfully executed in the terminal  
- `text_editor.png` – Screenshot of code loaded in a text editor

## 📘 Reflection  
Although this was mostly review, it helped solidify my workflow for upcoming projects. Capturing real screenshots reinforced confidence in my system setup and ensured that I could debug locally without relying on browser tools. This moment marked a quiet but essential milestone—the start of my hands-on Python journey.
