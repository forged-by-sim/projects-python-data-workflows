🌐 M6 – Interacting with JSON & REST APIs

Folder: m6-json-rest-api
Focus: Making web requests, parsing JSON responses, and integrating third-party APIs using Python’s urllib and json modules

⸻

🎯 Overview

This module introduced RESTful APIs and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as essential tools for working with external web services. Using Python, I learned how to construct URL requests, retrieve and decode JSON data, and extract relevant fields for further processing. These skills are critical for handling dynamic, real-time data in simulation engines and training platforms.

Key skills practiced:

Constructing REST API request URLs

Using urllib to retrieve data from the web

Decoding JSON responses with json.loads()

Navigating nested dictionaries and lists

Extracting and printing specific values from API results

🧪 Project: Extracting Data from JSON

Parsed a complex JSON structure containing embedded numeric values. Traversed nested lists and dictionaries to compute sums based on key-value pairs.

🗺️ Project: Geolocation via OpenStreetMap API

Constructed a RESTful request that accepts a user-entered address and retrieves latitude/longitude coordinates using the OpenStreetMap API.

📘 Reflection

This was a breakthrough moment for me in working with real-world data sources. The ability to write scripts that connect to external APIs, navigate messy JSON objects, and extract what I need gives me power and flexibility in simulation-driven workflows. Whether I’m logging simulation events or pulling geospatial data, these skills expand what I can automate, analyze, and build.
