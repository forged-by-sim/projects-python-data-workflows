# 💻 M2 – Installing Python & Setting Up  
**Folder**: `m2-installing-python`  
**Focus**: Setting up the local Python development environment and validating configuration success

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module focused on **getting the local development environment ready** for Python scripting. I installed Python on my machine, tested basic script execution, and confirmed that my workspace was set up for smooth experimentation going forward.

Setup tasks included:
- Installing Python on Windows
- Choosing a text editor for scripting (`.txt` / `.py`)
- Testing browser-based and local code execution
- Capturing screenshots to verify setup and assignment output

A test script was used to validate that the installation and system path were properly configured.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Installing and launching Python from the command line
- Choosing between text editors and IDEs
- Running `.txt` files for basic output testing
- Confirming setup with screenshots as proof of readiness

## 💭 Reflection  
Before this module, I'd never installed programming tools before. But by the end, I knew everything was working—and that gave me confidence. The simple setup process reminded me that **getting started is often the hardest part**, but once the tools are in place, the rest becomes easier.

This module gave me the green light to start coding with clarity.
