# 🧠 M1 – Why We Program  
**Folder**: `m1-why-we-program`  
**Focus**: Understanding the purpose behind programming and foundational computing logic

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced the **philosophy of programming**—not through syntax, but through ideas. It focused on the *why* before the *how*, helping me see code as more than logic—it’s a language of creation.

Key ideas explored:
- Programming as a tool for creativity, empowerment, and automation  
- How software interacts with memory, logic, and decision-making  
- Layers of computing systems (hardware/software interface)

This perspective helped me frame programming as an accessible and meaningful craft, not just a technical hurdle.

⸻

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Conceptualizing what it means to "write a program"
- Understanding abstraction in computing systems
- Shifting mindset from passive user to active creator
- Reflecting on the deeper *why* behind learning to code

## 💭 Reflection  
This module didn’t require any code—but it gave me something more valuable: **permission to begin**. It reshaped programming as something *for me*, even without prior experience. That mindset shift made all the technical skills that followed feel achievable.

Learning to code is also learning to think—and this module made that clear from day one.
