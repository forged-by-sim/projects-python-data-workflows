# 🔄 M7 – Loops, Iterations & Sentinel Logic  
**Folder**: `m7-loops-and-iterations`  
**Focus**: Building iterative logic with `while` and `for` loops, using sentinel values, and tracking extremes

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced **iteration** in Python—writing code that repeats with purpose. I learned to use `while` and `for` loops, accumulate values with logic patterns (`max`, `min`, `count`, `sum`), and exit gracefully with sentinel input like `"done"`.

The assignment focused on identifying the **largest** and **smallest** numbers in a user-defined sequence, validating input and handling errors along the way.

It was a turning point—where logic, control flow, and input handling all converged in a real program.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Writing `while` and `for` loops for input collection  
- Implementing sentinel-controlled loop exit (`"done"`)  
- Using accumulator patterns for `min`, `max`, and count logic  
- Handling invalid entries with `try/except`  
- Applying conditionals within loops to track and update variables

## 💭 Reflection  
This assignment felt like building a **tool**, not just solving an exercise. It accepted multiple inputs, handled errors, and revealed the power of well-structured loops.  

By the end, I wasn’t just writing Python—I was **using** it. The ability to loop until a condition is met, and track state along the way, gave me confidence in writing programs that think and adapt.
