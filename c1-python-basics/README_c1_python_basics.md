# 🐍 C1 – Python Basics & Programming Foundations  
**Folder**: `c1-python-basics`  
**Focus**: Building a foundational understanding of Python programming through variables, input, conditionals, functions, and loops

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This course introduced Python from the ground up—moving from conceptual thinking into hands-on coding. I built a strong foundation in programming logic and syntax, while gradually creating functional, user-driven scripts.

Across seven modules, I progressed from understanding **why programming matters** to confidently writing real scripts using **functions**, **conditionals**, **input handling**, and **iteration**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3 (local installation)
- Text Editors: Notepad, VS Code
- `.py`, `.txt`, `.png` files for scripting, testing, and screenshots
- Terminal / Command Line for local script execution

## 📁 Directory Structure

| Module Folder | Focus |
|---------------|-------|
| `m1-why-we-program` | Philosophy of programming and mental models |
| `m2-installing-python` | Local setup, text editors, and script runners |
| `m3-first-programming-steps` | Writing first script using `print()` |
| `m4-variables-and-expressions` | User input, expressions, type conversion |
| `m5-conditional-code` | Logic branching with `if`, `else`, `try/except` |
| `m6-functions` | Modularizing logic using custom functions |
| `m7-loops-and-iterations` | Iterating with `for`, `while`, and accumulators |

Each folder contains module-specific `.py` and `.txt` scripts, screenshots of output, and reflections.

## 💡 Reflection  
This course marked a turning point in my development journey. From the simplicity of `print("Hello World")` to the logic of tracking min/max with loops and writing reusable functions—each concept built upon the last.

More than just syntax, it gave me confidence. I now understand how to build scripts that **respond**, **calculate**, and **iterate**. I’m not just reading code—I’m writing it.

This course also marked my shift from no-code simulation tools into **code-driven workflows**—unlocking future potential in **data, simulation, and XR**.
