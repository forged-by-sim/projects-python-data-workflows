# 🔁 M6 – Writing Functions & Reusable Logic  
**Folder**: `m6-functions`  
**Focus**: Building modular code using user-defined functions, arguments, and return values

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced **functions** as reusable building blocks in Python. I learned how to define custom functions using `def`, pass in arguments, return values, and organize logic into cleaner code modules.

By applying this structure, I transformed a pay calculator into a modular, testable program with multiple outputs—all powered by reusable logic.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Defining custom functions using `def`  
- Passing arguments and returning values  
- Distinguishing between `return` and `print`  
- Practicing variable scope and logic reuse  
- Writing clear, repeatable blocks of logic

## 💭 Reflection  
This was the turning point where I stopped writing **step-by-step scripts** and started thinking like a developer.

Functions helped me shift into **modular thinking**: solve one piece, then reuse it. Repeating logic became easier to manage, test, and trust. I now understand how clean, scalable programs are built—not by doing more, but by doing **less, better**.

This is a skill I’ll carry into every future coding project.
