# 🧮 M4 – Variables, Expressions & Input  
**Folder**: `m4-variables-and-expressions`  
**Focus**: Creating interactive Python programs with variables, arithmetic, and input/output handling

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module introduced the building blocks of dynamic programs: **variables**, **expressions**, and **user input**. I learned how to store values, accept user input, and perform arithmetic operations in Python.

Along the way, I also explored:
- How Python reads input as strings by default
- The importance of **type conversion** (e.g., `int()`, `float()`, `str()`)
- Basic use of the `input()` and `print()` functions
- Arithmetic expressions and operator precedence

This module marked a shift toward interactive logic—programs that respond to user behavior.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Capturing user input and storing it as variables  
- Performing arithmetic and string operations  
- Using `input()` and `print()` for interaction  
- Applying type conversion to handle different data types  
- Practicing expression structure and evaluation

## 💭 Reflection  
This was the first time I built a script that *responded to me*. Writing an interactive welcome message made programming feel personal and responsive.  

Type conversion initially felt abstract, but became clear through repetition and output testing. With this foundation, I started thinking in **decision logic**—how input transforms into output through structured expression.
