# 🧾 M5 – Conditional Logic & Overtime Pay  
**Folder**: `m5-conditional-code`  
**Focus**: Using conditional statements and exception handling to create logic-driven Python applications

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module focused on writing programs that **adapt based on user input**. I explored conditional execution using `if`, `else`, and `elif`, as well as how to handle invalid or unexpected input using `try`/`except`.

The main assignment was an **Overtime Pay Calculator**, which determined if a user worked over 40 hours and applied the correct pay multiplier. It introduced concepts of **branching logic**, **error handling**, and **real-world calculations**.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Implementing multi-branch logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Nesting conditionals to guide decision-making  
- Using `try`/`except` to handle input errors and prevent crashes  
- Performing numeric calculations and comparisons  
- Structuring scripts for clarity and user feedback

## 💭 Reflection  
This assignment felt like a shift into *real* programming. It challenged me to think through multiple user scenarios—what if someone enters invalid hours? Leaves a blank field? Mistypes the rate?

Learning `try/except` gave me the confidence to build programs that won’t just work—but will **fail gracefully**.

This was the moment Python became a tool I could use to solve practical, everyday problems with logic and empathy.
