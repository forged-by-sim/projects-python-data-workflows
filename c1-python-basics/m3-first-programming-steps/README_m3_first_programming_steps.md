# 🐍 M3 – First Programming Steps  
**Folder**: `m3-first-programming-steps`  
**Focus**: Writing the first Python script and exploring programming purpose, syntax, and structure

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module marked my first hands-on interaction with Python. I wrote a basic program using the `print()` function to display output in the console, and began to internalize how simple instructions translate into real action.

Alongside scripting, I explored key programming concepts:
- The purpose of programming and automation
- Differences between high-level and low-level languages
- Interaction between memory, logic, and CPU cycles
- Syntax basics: print statements, indentation, and quotation rules

Completing this module confirmed that I was no longer just observing code—I was writing it.

## 💭 Reflection  
Seeing `"Hello World"` appear on the screen was a simple but powerful moment—it made programming real. This wasn’t just about syntax; it was about making the machine respond to *my* instructions.

This first line of code shifted me from consumer to creator—and that mindset continues to shape how I approach each new concept.
