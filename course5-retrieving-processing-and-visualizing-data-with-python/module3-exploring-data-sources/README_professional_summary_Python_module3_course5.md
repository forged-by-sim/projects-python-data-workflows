📘 Module 3 — Exploring Data Sources

Course: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
Specialization: Python for Everybody
Platform: University of Michigan – Coursera
Folder: module3-exploring-data-sources

🎯 Module Objective

Module 3 introduces the optional Capstone Project pathway. The focus of this week is identifying a potential dataset to analyze later using Python, SQLite, APIs, or visualization tools.

This module is conceptual — learners explore possible data sources, think about questions that could be answered with data, and submit a short discussion post. No required coding or graded assessments.

📚 Topics Covered

Introduction to selecting meaningful data sources

Examples of curated datasets across fields (health, education, social sciences, environment, etc.)

Choosing data formats suitable for analysis (CSV, JSON, XML, HTML)

Brainstorming possible analysis questions

Discussion on feasibility and scope

📝 Coursework Included

Discussion Post: Identifying a Data Source
Although not a graded assignment, the module required a brief reflection on:

The chosen dataset

Why it was interesting

Possible questions to explore

What types of processing or visualization might be needed

(If you want, we can also write a README-friendly summary of your discussion post.)

No Python scripts were required for this module.

🛠️ Tools Referenced (Conceptual Only)

While not used directly in Module 3, learners prepare to work with:

Python 3

Web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup, urllib)

APIs + JSON responses

SQL databases

Plotting libraries (matplotlib / Google Charts)

These tools form the backbone of the Capstone workflows introduced in later modules.

💡 Reflection

Module 3 served as a creative planning stage. It encouraged thinking beyond predefined assignments and imagining what real-world questions can be answered with good data.

Although the Capstone Project was optional, completing this step made the course feel more flexible and personal — connecting the upcoming technical work to real interests and real datasets.
