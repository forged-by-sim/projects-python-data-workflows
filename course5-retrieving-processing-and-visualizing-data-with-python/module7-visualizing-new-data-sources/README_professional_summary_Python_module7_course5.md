📘 Module 7 — Visualizing New Data Sources

Course: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
Specialization: Python for Everybody
Platform: University of Michigan – Coursera
Folder: module7-visualizing-new-data-sources

🎯 Module Objective

Module 7 concludes the optional Capstone Project track by asking learners to reflect on the analysis and visualization of their chosen dataset.

The focus of this week is communicating what was learned from the data — whether through charts, patterns, summaries, or insights. Visualization was encouraged but not required, making this a highly flexible, conceptual module.

No Python code or graded assignments were required.

📚 Topics Covered

Principles of effective data analysis

Choosing the right visualization for the right question

Summarizing findings and communicating insights

Using clear narrative structure to explain analysis outcomes

Optional exploration of Python-based or external visualization tools

📝 Coursework Included

Discussion Post: Data Analysis and Visualization

This reflection focused on:

What dataset was analyzed

What patterns or insights were observed

How the data could be visualized (chart type, trends, comparisons)

Explanation of analytical steps or thought process

Interpretation of results

No uploads, scripts, or visualizations were required — only a written summary for peer review.

🛠️ Tools Referenced (Conceptual Only)

Although Module 7 did not require coding, the readings referenced tools that could be used for visualizations:

matplotlib (Python plotting)

Google Charts (browser-based visualizations)

SQLite (query insights before graphing)

CSV/JSON parsers (data prep)

These tools align with the technical work done earlier in the capstone.

💡 Reflection

Module 7 encouraged a shift from processing data to communicating meaning.
It highlighted that analysis is not only about writing code — it’s also about telling a clear story using:

thoughtful observations

appropriate chart types

clean summaries

concise explanations

This final step brought closure to the capstone journey by reinforcing the importance of interpretability and clarity in any data science workflow.
