📘 Module 6: Visualizing Word Frequencies & Message Timelines

Specialization: Python for Everybody
Course: Capstone – Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
Platform: Coursera – University of Michigan
Directory: module6-gword_gline/

⸻

🎯 Module Objective

Module 6 introduced visualization techniques for exploring large text-based datasets. Using the cleaned mailing-list database produced in earlier modules, this section focused on:

Extracting word-frequency data

Visualizing text distributions through a word cloud

Plotting trends in message activity through monthly and yearly timelines

Practicing the workflow of exporting SQLite data → processing in Python → generating browser-based visualizations

The result is a lightweight mini-analytics dashboard created entirely with Python and standard web technologies.

⸻

🛠️ Tools & Scripts Used

Python 3

SQLite (content.sqlite)

gmodel.py – prepares message & sender tables

gbasic.py – computes participant statistics

gword.py – generates word cloud data

gline.py – generates timeline CSV → visualized in HTML

HTML / JavaScript (Google Charts)

Browser (Firefox) to view:

gword.htm

gline.htm

year/gline.htm

📊 Visual Outputs
1. Participant & Organization Statistics

Generated by gbasic.py
Provides:

Top individual email contributors

Top organizations/domains

Counts used to validate data modeling

2. Word Cloud (gword.py → gword.htm)

Highlights:

Most frequent terms from subject lines

Larger words = higher frequency

Provides fast qualitative insight into discussion themes

3. Timeline of Messages (gline.py → gline.htm)

Two visualizations were produced:

Messages per Month

Messages per Year

These graphs show how the activity of the mailing list changes over time. Even though the Sakai dataset is synthetic for the assignment, the patterns demonstrate:

Seasonal rise/fall in participation

Bursts of activity around major version or feature discussions

Year-over-year variations

📈 What This Module Demonstrates Professionally

This module showcases skills relevant to data analytics, data engineering, and ETL workflows:

Extracting structured data from databases

Modeling communication datasets

Manipulating data programmatically with Python

Building HTML-based data visualizations

Working with JS libraries for interactive analytics

Troubleshooting visualization pipelines

This is a strong technical demonstration of ETL → Modeling → Visualization.

⸻

🔎 What I Learned

How to extract analytic datasets directly from SQLite

How to transform text into frequency dictionaries

How front-end tools like Google Charts connect with Python-generated JSON

How to build real data workflows that pass information from:

Database → Python → JavaScript → Browser

Gained confidence debugging multi-script pipelines

⸻

💡 Reflection

This module ties together the entire specialization by transitioning from raw data → cleaned data → interpretable visualizations. The workflow is lightweight, efficient, and mirrors real-world data journalism and analytics processes.

The visualizations created here form the final layer of the capstone: turning processed data into insights.
