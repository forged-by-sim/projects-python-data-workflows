🎯 Module Objective

Module 1 serves as a short introduction to the capstone experience. It outlines the purpose of the course, explains how the capstone integrates all previous Python for Everybody modules, and provides the overall workflow for the upcoming assignments.

This module is informational only — no scripts, quizzes, or coding exercises were required.

📚 Topics Covered

Course expectations and capstone workflow

Overview of data retrieval, processing, and visualization tasks

Review of Python fundamentals used throughout the specialization

Syllabus and resource materials

Capstone completion pathways (regular certificate vs. honors)

📝 Coursework Included

JSON/XML parsing

SQLite

Google Charts / Matplotlib

💡 Reflection

Module 1 marked the transition from guided coursework to a full project-driven capstone. It reinforced how much foundational knowledge was already in place — from loops, functions, and file handling to database operations and data visualization.

This introduction set the stage for a smoother workflow in the advanced modules that followed.
