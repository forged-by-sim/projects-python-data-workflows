📘 Module 5 — Accessing New Data Sources

Course: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
Specialization: Python for Everybody
Platform: University of Michigan – Coursera
Folder: module5-accessing-new-data-sources

🎯 Module Objective

Module 5 continues the optional Capstone Project pathway. This week asks learners to reflect on their progress retrieving, cleaning, and preparing data from a chosen source. The task is focused on developing analysis insights rather than writing code.

There were no required scripts or graded assignments — only a short discussion submission.

📚 Topics Covered

Progress updates for your chosen Capstone dataset

Techniques for retrieving data using Python tools

Best practices for cleaning raw data

Early-stage thoughts on how to structure analysis

Peer feedback and refinement of data-preparation strategy

📝 Coursework Included

Discussion Post: Analyzing a Data Source
This submission asked learners to briefly explain:

The dataset being accessed

How the data was retrieved or downloaded

Any cleaning or preprocessing performed so far

Potential obstacles (formatting issues, missing data, etc.)

Next steps for analysis or visualization

No Python files were required in this module.

🛠️ Tools Referenced (Conceptual Only)

Although no scripts were created in Module 5, the readings introduced or reinforced concepts related to:

Python 3 data retrieval techniques

Accessing APIs and JSON structures

HTML/CSV/JSON/XML parsing

Data cleaning workflows

Preparing datasets for SQLite or visualization libraries

These tools become active again in Modules 6 and 7.

💡 Reflection

Module 5 helped clarify the workflow of moving from “raw dataset” to “analysis-ready data.” Even without coding, this week sharpened your approach by having you articulate:

what data you want,

why it matters, and

how you plan to process it.

It offered a structured pause to think about the strategy behind the Capstone Project — a useful step before returning to hands-on Python in the final modules.
