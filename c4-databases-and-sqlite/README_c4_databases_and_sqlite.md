# 🗃️ C4 – Databases & SQLite Integration with Python  
**Folder**: `c4-databases-and-sqlite`  
**Focus**: Designing relational databases, querying structured data, and building data pipelines using Python and SQLite  

⸻

🎯 Overview

This course explored the intersection of **Python and relational databases**, guiding me through building, querying, and visualizing structured data using SQLite. I practiced working with flat files, CSVs, JSON, and multi-table schemas — then wrote Python scripts to automate data ingestion and reporting. The course culminated in **geospatial data visualization**, combining SQL logic with frontend mapping tools.

Each module below reflects a core phase of database mastery:

| Module | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| `m1-object-oriented-python` | OOP foundations for structuring code and data models |
| `m2-sql-select-and-joins` | CRUD operations and single-table SQL querying via Python |
| `m3-relational-modeling-sqlite` | Foreign key design and multi-table JOIN queries |
| `m4-many-to-many-sqlite` | Modeling and querying many-to-many relationships with normalized schemas |
| `m5-databases-and-visualization` | Visualizing geolocation data using OpenStreetMap with Python + JavaScript |

🧰 Tools Used

- Python (`sqlite3`, `json`, `urllib`)  
- SQLite (.sqlite and .sql scripts)  
- JavaScript (`where.js`, OpenStreetMap API)  
- HTML + JS for basic map rendering  
- VS Code, DB Browser for SQLite

📘 Reflection

This was the most integrated course in the Python specialization — bridging back-end logic with front-end visualization. I left with confidence not only in writing SQL queries, but also in **designing normalized schemas, building ETL pipelines**, and handling real-world data formats like `.csv`, `.json`, and `.sqlite`.

These skills directly support my ability to log simulation data, analyze learning outcomes, and power visualization dashboards in XR or medical training platforms.
