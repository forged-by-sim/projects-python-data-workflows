Retrieving GEOData
Download the code from www.py4e.com/code3/opengeo.zip - then unzip the file and edit where.data to add an address nearby where you live - don't reveal where you live. Suggestions for the new location are: a local library, museum, park, cafe, etc. Something representative of your local culture. This is your chance to be creative. If multiple students from the same university are taking the course at the same time please do not all choose the university you are attending as the new location. Then run the geoload.py to lookup all of the entries in where.data (including the new one) and produce the geodata.sqlite. Then run geodump.py to read the database and produce where.js. You can run the programs and then scroll back to take your screen shots when the program finishes. Then open where.html to visualize the map. Take screen shots as described below. Make sure that your added location shows in all three of your screen shots.




Notes: Location is University of Central Florida
