# 🧱 M1 – Object-Oriented Python  
**Folder**: `m1-object-oriented-python`  
**Focus**: Foundational object-oriented programming principles used to structure and scale data-driven applications  

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module revisited core **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, setting the stage for structured data modeling and integration with future database layers. I practiced defining custom classes, using attributes and methods, managing object state, and decoding data — all fundamental for building modular and maintainable code.

⸻

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Defining and instantiating Python classes  
- Using `__init__()` constructors to set initial object state  
- Defining and calling custom methods  
- Accessing and modifying object attributes  
- Working with encoded character data in Python 3  
- Connecting OOP structures to real-world data workflows (e.g., databases, APIs)

## 🧠 Practice Files

- `object-oriented-programming-practice.txt` | Notes and exercises demonstrating custom class creation, method logic, and attribute handling |
- `using-encoded-data-in-python3-practice.txt` | Supplemental example on decoding and managing text encoding in Python 3 (e.g., UTF-8) — important when handling input from web APIs or databases |

⸻

## 🧭 Reflection  
This was a valuable refresher on OOP fundamentals, reinforcing how to **organize logic around objects** and design re-usable class structures. While the code here is intentionally simple, it laid the groundwork for scalable systems — especially in later modules where I applied these skills to **relational modeling and database interaction**.
