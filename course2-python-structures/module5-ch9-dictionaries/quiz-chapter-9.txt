if key in counts:
    counts[key] = counts[key] + 1
else:
    counts[key] = 1


==> counts[key] = counts.get(key,0) + 1


7. In the following Python, what does the for loop iterate through?


x = dict()
...
for y in x :
     ...


==> It loops through the keys in the dictionary


8. Which method in a dictionary object gives you a list of the values in the dictionary?
