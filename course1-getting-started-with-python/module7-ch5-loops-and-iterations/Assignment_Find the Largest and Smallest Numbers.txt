5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
  
 

largest = None
smallest = None
while True:
    inp = input("Enter a number: ")
    if inp == "done":
        break
    try: 
        num = float(inp)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue
        
    if smallest is None:
        smallest = num
        largest = num
    if num < smallest:
        smallest = num 
    elif num > largest:
        largest = num 
        
print("Maximum is", int(largest))
print("Minimum is", int(smallest))

 


Enter a number: 7

Enter a number: 2 

Enter a number: bob

Enter a number: 10

Enter a number: 4
